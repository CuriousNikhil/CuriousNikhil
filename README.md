### Hi there 👋, 
Thanks for stopping by! 
Hey there, I'm [**Nikhil**](https://nikhilchaudhari.me/) 🙂 

I work on Android, Kotlin, Java. Currently working on android Payment's app at @paypay corp.  
Previously, I was in @helpshift where I worked on creating android SDKs/Libraries and Unity, Xamarin.

I'm exploring Jetpack Compose 🚀 mostly with the canvas and drawing approach that Jetpack Compose has taken. Please checkout my repos where I mostly play with canvas and drawing to create awesome stuff. 🖌️🎨

Follow me on twitter [@CuriousNikhyl](https://twitter.com/CuriousNikhyl) where I usually upload cool animations and simulations using Jetpack Compose. DM me your interesting problems😉

I sometimes write intesting stuff on Android - do checkout my blogs on medium https://mrcurious.medium.com/
